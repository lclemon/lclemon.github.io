I am a design engineer, sustainable and additive manufacturing professional, and tenacious problem solver. I consult on manufacturing and design challenges as well as conduct individual research. 

My work present work targets:

<ol>
  <li>Environmental, social, and economic assessment and improvement of products and manufacturing processes</li>
  <li>Design engineering for mechanical, pressurized, and hazardous processes</li>
  <li>Additive manufacturing process improvement and optimization</li>
  <li>Materials processing and pathways for a more circular economy</li>
</ol>

In addition, I serve the American Society of Mechanical Engineers both in codes and standards for pressure vessels and in developing volunteer leaders.
