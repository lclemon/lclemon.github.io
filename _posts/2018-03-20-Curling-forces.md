Watching the winter olympics in Pyeongchang inspired me to do a bit of analysis of curling. In this post we'll examine the force balance of a moving stone as well as it's trajectory without sweeping. 

[comment]: <> Insert force balance image here

I separate the frictional force into 4 locations around the bottom of the rock. I ignore drag throughout. 
<ol type="A">
  <li>North - direction toward the thrower</li>
  <li>South - direction toward the target area</li>
  <li>East - right of the play area</li>
  <li>West - left of the play area</li>
</ol>
