A common tool in a manufacturing plant is that of the [control chart]. 
This handy time-series data plot gives a process engineer a quick check on how the line is performing and can also
provide a signal for intervention. 

As an example, Good Parts, Inc. is making widgets where a critical dimension is specifed at 5.000 \pm 0.003. 
Widgets are [link:random sampling]randomly sampled for inspection. The results of these tests are then plotted 
on a control chart (Figure 1) and fed up the chain-of-command for review. 



It must be emphasized that a control chart notifies you of a deviation in that which you measure. 

Let's continue the example. Good Parts, Inc. is making widgets to clear a backlog. Good Parts, Inc. has 3 processing lines each of which make the same widget. 

Line 1: throughput = 100/hr
Line 2: throughput = 80/hr
Line 3: throughput = 110/hr
